# react-wp-break-tracker
WordPress plugin for tracking and submitting breaks for a call center technical support team. The plugin is written using WordPress's REST API and admin dashboard and Facebook's React JavaScript library.

The plugin does not use JSX for defining the React component's template. The React files will run as is if the required React JavaScript files are loaded in the page. Using JSX with compiled React scripts would probably be a better and easier solution, but some folks may find having to use Node.js unpalatable.

To install to WordPress, download a zip of the project and install using WordPress's plugin upload functionality. The plugin can also be manually installed by copying the files into a new folder in the WordPress plugin directory.
